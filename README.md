Wavelets 
===

An educational resource on Wavelet research that I am doing to feed my own curiosity, and because I think that Wavelets may have more applications than they currently are used for.

Please please _please_ do not use any of this code for production purposes. Feel free to use the code as inspiration, or to read it for the heck of it, or whatever you'd like (consistent with the MIT license), but this code should
not be treated as industrial-strength code, it's mainly a holding ground for research and experimentation.
